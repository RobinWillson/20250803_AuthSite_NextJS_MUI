### Step 1: Gather Project Information
1. "What is your project name?" 
>> 20250625_AuthSite_Kodu

2. "Brief project description?"
>> I will like to create a membership website
But let's start by simple step.
We build an authenticate signin and login system first

3. "Project type?"
   - Simple (basic scripts/utilities)
   - Standard (full application)
   - AI/ML (ML/data science project)
   - Custom (user defines structure)
>> Standard

4. "Primary language?" (Python/JavaScript/TypeScript/Java/Other)
>> JavaScript

5. "Set up GitHub repository?" (Yes-New/Yes-Existing/No)
>> Yes-Existing



# UI
1. While access the homepage, user will see a beautiful background with clean three button near center, which are "Login with Google", "Login by Email" and "Sign up".
2. While clicked "Login with Google", we detect if the user is signed up before. If we don't have this user, we make him registered at background and treat him as new user.
3. While SignUp button clicked, redirect to register page.
4. While user sign in successfully, we show them a welcome page.
5. I want to build an admin page. This page shows a list of user. And each user item has button at right, that admin can remove user.
6. If Email or Google Account is "xxxx@gmail.com", then it is admin.
