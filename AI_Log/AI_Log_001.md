> Currently is a full-stack authentication application with React frontend and Node.js backend.
  It is now worked fine with good frontend.

  Now I will like to be transfer to a "nextJS version 14" based Authentication Site.

  - Please give plan first rather than just modify the code.
  - Do file modification or command execution once a time. Step by Step is Important.

● I'll help you migrate from the current React + Vite frontend to Next.js 14. Let me create a comprehensive plan first.

● Update Todos
  ⎿  ☐ Create migration plan for Next.js 14
     ☐ Analyze current client structure for migration
     ☐ Set up Next.js 14 project structure
     ☐ Migrate authentication context and services
     ☐ Convert React Router to Next.js App Router
     ☐ Test and verify functionality
     ☐ Migrate components and pages
     ☐ Update styling (Material-UI + TailwindCSS)

● Migration Plan: React + Vite → Next.js 14

  Phase 1: Analysis & Setup

  1. Analyze current client structure - Review components, pages, routing, and dependencies
  2. Create new Next.js 14 project - Initialize with App Router (recommended for new projects)
  3. Configure dependencies - Migrate Material-UI, TailwindCSS, and authentication libraries

  Phase 2: Core Architecture Migration

  4. Authentication System
    - Convert AuthContext to Next.js compatible context
    - Migrate auth services to work with Next.js API routes or keep backend integration
    - Implement Next.js middleware for route protection
  5. Routing Migration
    - Convert React Router routes to Next.js App Router structure
    - Migrate protected routes using Next.js middleware or layout components
    - Convert dynamic routes and navigation

  Phase 3: Components & Pages

  6. Component Migration
    - Move shared components (Header, Footer, Sidebar, etc.)
    - Update imports and ensure Next.js compatibility
    - Migrate Material-UI components and theme
  7. Page Migration
    - Convert pages to Next.js page components
    - Implement proper layout structure
    - Update styling integration (Material-UI + TailwindCSS)

  Phase 4: Configuration & Testing

  8. Configuration
    - Set up Next.js config for Material-UI and TailwindCSS
    - Configure environment variables
    - Set up build and development scripts
  9. Testing & Verification
    - Test authentication flow
    - Verify all routes and protected areas
    - Ensure styling works correctly

  Key Considerations:

  - Keep backend unchanged - Only migrate frontend to Next.js
  - Use App Router - Next.js 14's recommended routing system
  - Server-side considerations - Decide on SSR/SSG strategy for auth pages
  - Middleware approach - Use Next.js middleware for route protection instead of React Router guards

  Would you like me to proceed with this plan step by step? I'll start with analyzing the current structure and then move through each phase
  systematically.
