Here we already have a site that has function to authenticate users.
Now I'm going to build all pages to make it more friendly and looks more commercial. 
But it comes a problem.
In my development environment, there is sometimes offline.
I can't connect to server site or database.
And as I know all these pages can be accessed only after login.
Is there any suggest that I can temporary ignore the check of user while developing front end website?
